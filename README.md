# shutdown-timer-
This is simple application written in .Net to make your PC shutdown and to log off according to time chosen by you!!
When I was downloading something using torrent and I wasn't able to control like if downloading is done then my PC should shutdown itself automatically.
Then I wrote this tiny application in .Net which allows you to choose specific time and action and perform that action based on your choice.
